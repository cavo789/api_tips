# Responses

# 200 OK

A server MUST respond to a successful request to fetch an individual resource or resource collection with a `200 OK` response.

When `DELETE` was used, we can also return `204 No Content` to inform the calling application that deletion was successful.

# 201 Created

If the requested resource has been created successfully and the server changes the resource in any way (for example, by assigning an id), the server MUST return a `201 Created` response and the new added resource in body.

# 202 Accepted

If a request to create/update or delete a resource has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed by the time the server responds, the server MUST return a `202 Accepted` status code.

# 204 No Content

If the requested resource has been created successfully and the server does not change the resource in any way (for example, by assigning an id or `createdAt` attribute), the server MUST return either a `201 Created` status code and the resource in response or a `204 No Content` status code with no response document.

If the deletion was done successfully, `204 No Content` can be used too.

For an update, it's the same: we can send code `200 OK` with the updated resource in the body or, code `204 No Content` without body; just headers.

# 400 Not Found

You should return a `400 Bad Request` response when the call was incorrect like an unknown value is used for a parameter (like `&lang=it` when Italian isn't supported).

# 403 Forbidden

A server MUST return `403 Forbidden` in response to an unsupported request to, for instance, create a resource (with `POST` verb with a client-generated `ID` since the `ID` has to be generated by the server, not the client).

# 404 Not Found

A server MUST respond with `404 Not Found` when processing a request to fetch a single resource that does not exist, except when the request warrants a 200 OK response with null as the primary data (as described above).

# 409 Conflict

A server MUST return `409 Conflict` when processing a `POST` request to create a resource with a client-generated `ID` that already exists.

A server MUST return `409 Conflict` when processing a `POST` request in which the resource object's type is not among the type(s) that constitute the collection represented by the endpoint.
