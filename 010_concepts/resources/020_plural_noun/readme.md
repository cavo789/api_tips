# Prefer plural noun

Always use the plural like `GET /employees/1` to return the first employee and not `GET /employee/1`.

Using the plural make it easier to understand that `employees` is a collection and we can use verbs like `GET` to get all, one or a range, `POST` to add a new employee, `PUT` to update a employee's information.
