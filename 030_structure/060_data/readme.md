# Data

> [https://jsonapi.org/format/#document-top-level](https://jsonapi.org/format/#document-top-level)

As described in [Top Level items](https://jsonapi.org/format/#document-top-level), the returned information should be put as a top level node called `data`:

Best is to always use the array notation so we can return one or more rows.

```json
'data': [
    [ ... ]
]
```
